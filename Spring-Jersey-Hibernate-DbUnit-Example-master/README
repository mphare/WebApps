Long Answer
    Try running the Unit Tests first. Right Click on the project in eclipse and select
    'Run As' > 'JUnit Test' After the test fails. Click 'Run' > 'Run Configurations...' 
    and select 'Spring-Jersey-JPA-DbUnit-Example' Click on the 'Classpath' tab, and in
    the Classpath view, select 'User Entries'. Click the 'Advanced' button in the dialog
    box, select 'Add Folders' and click 'OK'. In the next dialog box, Navigate to 
    'Spring-Jersy-JPA-DbUnit-Example > target' and select the directory 'test-classes'
    and press the 'OK' button

    Now Apply and 'Run' and the unit tests should run fine.
